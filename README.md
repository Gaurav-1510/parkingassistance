This project is an object detection and parking assistance system.
It uses ultrasonic sensors to detect objects, even in blind spots.
The system displays detected objects on the car's dashboard.
I employed key OOP concepts using C++ and Python.
Autosar was used to develop the architecture of the project.
The project demonstrates my understanding of Gen AI and prompt engineering.
I played a key role in checking and finding MISRA violations in the generated code.
The project was developed using STM32 Cube IDE.
It showcases my ability to work with various technologies, including Autosar and Embedded C.
The outcome was a fully functional object detection and parking assistance system.
